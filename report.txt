Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing
Student: Paul Mbuvi
Course: STA / Financial Mathematics
Method: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
Simulations: 10,000

1. Expected Stock Price After 1 Year
------------------------------------

Expected stock price: 104.984355946451

- This is the mean of all 10,000 simulated stock prices at maturity.

2. Standard Deviation of Simulated Prices
-----------------------------------------

Standard deviation: 21.145030155066106

- This shows the spread/volatility of the simulated stock prices.

3. Monte Carlo Price of the Call Option
----------------------------------------

Call option price: 7.917290295148607

- This is based on the discounted payoff

      C=e−rTE[max(ST​−K,0)]

4. Monte Carlo Price of the Put Option
---------------------------------------

Put option price: 7.932171379202865

This is based on the discounted payoff

      P=e−rTE[max(K−ST​,0)]

5. Effect of Increasing Volatility (σ = 10%, 20%, 30%)
------------------------------------------------------

From the histograms and simulation:

- Higher volatility widens the distribution of stock prices.

- There is more uncertainty, so the distribution becomes flatter and more spread out.

- Both call and put option values increase with volatility:

- Calls gain value from more upside potential.

- Puts gain value from more downside risk.

Thus, volatility increases option prices overall.

6. Role of the Random Variable
-------------------------------

In the GBM model,

     ST​=S0​exp((r−0.5σ^2)T+σsqrtT​Z)
     where Z ~ N(0,1).

- Z represents random shocks affecting the stock price.

- It introduces uncertainty into the stock return.

- It models real-world randomness such as news, market behaviour, and investor reactions.

- Without Z, all simulated prices would be identical (no randomness).

- Thus, Z is essential for capturing realistic stock price behavior.

Interpretations for the Graphs
------------------------------
Figure: Histogram of Simulated Stock Prices After 1 Year

- This histogram shows the distribution of the 10,000 simulated stock prices generated using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. The shape is approximately right-skewed, which is expected because GBM produces log-normally distributed prices. Most simulated prices cluster around the mean value (approximately 105), and this average is marked by the vertical green line.

- The spread of the histogram reflects the volatility (σ = 0.20). A wider spread indicates more uncertainty in the final stock price after one year. The long right tail shows that while most price outcomes fall in a typical range, there is a probability of large upward movements in the stock price — a characteristic of financial returns modeled with GBM.


Figure: Comparison of Volatility Levels (σ = 0.10, 0.20, 0.30)

This graph compares the effect of three different volatility levels on the distribution of simulated stock prices after one year.
With low volatility (σ = 0.10), the distribution is narrow and tightly concentrated around the mean. This indicates low uncertainty and minimal price fluctuation.
At moderate volatility (σ = 0.20), the spread becomes wider, showing increased variability in possible future stock prices.
With high volatility (σ = 0.30), the distribution becomes extremely wide and flat, meaning a very large range of possible outcomes — from very low prices to extremely high prices.

The key interpretation is that higher volatility increases the spread of possible stock prices.
As volatility rises:
1. The distribution becomes flatter and more dispersed,
2. Uncertainty in price increases,
3. There is a greater probability of extreme outcomes (both high and low).

In Conclusion, these histograms illustrate the central impact of volatility in Monte Carlo simulations:
higher volatility → wider price distribution → higher option values.
