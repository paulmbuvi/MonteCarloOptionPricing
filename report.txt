Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing
Student: Paul Mbuvi
Course: STA / Financial Mathematics
Method: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
Simulations: 10,000

1. Expected Stock Price After 1 Year
------------------------------------

Expected stock price: 104.984355946451

- This is the mean of all 10,000 simulated stock prices at maturity.

2. Standard Deviation of Simulated Prices
-----------------------------------------

Standard deviation: 21.145030155066106

- This shows the spread/volatility of the simulated stock prices.

3. Monte Carlo Price of the Call Option
----------------------------------------

Call option price: 7.917290295148607

- This is based on the discounted payoff

      C=e−rTE[max(ST​−K,0)]

4. Monte Carlo Price of the Put Option
---------------------------------------

Put option price: 7.932171379202865

This is based on the discounted payoff

      P=e−rTE[max(K−ST​,0)]

5. Effect of Increasing Volatility (σ = 10%, 20%, 30%)
------------------------------------------------------

From the histograms and simulation:

- Higher volatility widens the distribution of stock prices.

- There is more uncertainty, so the distribution becomes flatter and more spread out.

- Both call and put option values increase with volatility:

- Calls gain value from more upside potential.

- Puts gain value from more downside risk.

Thus, volatility increases option prices overall.

6. Role of the Random Variable
-------------------------------

In the GBM model,

     ST​=S0​exp((r−0.5σ^2)T+σsqrtT​Z)
     where Z ~ N(0,1).

- Z represents random shocks affecting the stock price.

- It introduces uncertainty into the stock return.

- It models real-world randomness such as news, market behaviour, and investor reactions.

- Without Z, all simulated prices would be identical (no randomness).

- Thus, Z is essential for capturing realistic stock price behavior.
